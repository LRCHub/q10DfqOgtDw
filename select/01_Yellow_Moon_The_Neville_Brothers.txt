Oh, yellow Moon, yellow Moon
Why you keep peeping in my window?
Do you know something?
Do you know something that I don't know?

Did you see my baby?
Walking down the railroad tracks?
Oh, you can tell me, oh, if the girls ever coming back

Is she hid out with another?
Or is she trying to get back home?
Is she wrapped up in some other's arms?
Or is the girl somewhere all alone?

Can you see if she is missing me?
Or is she having a real good time?
Has she forgotten all about me?
Or is the girl still mine all mine?

With your eye so big and shiny
You can see the whole damn land
Yellow moon, can you tell me
If the girl's with another man, man

Whoa, whoa, whoa, woo
Yellow moon, yellow moon, yellow moon
Have you seen that creole woman?
You can tell me
Oh, now ain't you a friend of mine?

With your eye so big and shiny
You can see the whole damn land
Yellow moon, can you tell me
If the girl's with another man, man

Whoa, whoa, whoa, woo
Yellow moon, yellow moon, yellow moon
Have you seen that creole woman?
You can tell me
Oh, now ain't you a friend of mine?
